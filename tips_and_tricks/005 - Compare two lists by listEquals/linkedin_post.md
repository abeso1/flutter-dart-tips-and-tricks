When comparing two lists in Flutter, make sure to use listEquals instead of ‘==’

Why?

Because ‘==’ doesn't check if the lists have the same value. It only checks if they're the same instance. 

This means two lists containing identical elements may still be considered unequal if they are not the same instance.


That’s why you should use the listEquals function.

It compares lists element by element, and returns true if everything matches.


This also improves the readability of your code and prevents any bug that might come from incorrect list comparison.
