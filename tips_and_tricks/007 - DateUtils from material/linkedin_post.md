Need additional methods for working with dates in Flutter?

Check out the DateUtils class from the material package.

It comes with great helper methods like:
 - dateOnly
 - addDaysToDate
 - isSameDay

No need to reinvent the wheel and write these methods from scratch.


P.S. Do you already use DateUtils or do you write your own custom methods for DateTime?
