Flutter tip: Use the whereType<T>() method to safely filter a list by a class type


If you have a list that contains objects of different types, there’s a clean and type-safe method to filter it.


Use whereType<T>() to avoid manually checking types and casting.


This leads to:

 - Cleaner and more readable code
 - No need for ‘as’ and ‘is’ checks
 - Fewer runtime errors
 - Easier maintenance


This is a quick and easy method to make your codebase better instantly!
