FutureBuilder can slow down your app and increase your costs 

That’s why it's important to use it correctly.


Every time the widget rebuilds, the future inside FutureBuilder might be called again


That leads to:
 - Higher backend costs
 - Repeated API calls
 - Higher API costs
 - Slower UI


Most of the time, you won’t notice this until a high and unexpected bill comes your way.

A small mistake in how you use FutureBuilder can have a big impact.
